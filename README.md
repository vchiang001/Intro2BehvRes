<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Ufuoma%20Ovienmhada.jpg" width="15%"> 
Ufuoma Ovienmhada is a third year PhD student at MIT in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department. She studies applications of satellite remote sensing data for environmental justice. In her dissertation, she employs a multi-method approach to research the distribution of environmental hazards in carceral landscapes and co-design Earth Observation technologies to support environmental justice advocacy. Prior to beginning her PhD, she completed a Masters in the MIT Media Lab. Her Masters Thesis focused on applying remote sensing, low-cost sensors, drone data collection and community-centered design techniques to invasive plant species management in West Africa. Before arriving at MIT, she completed a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University.
</p>
Topic: Satellite Data for Environmental Justice: A Case Study of U.S. Prison Landscapes
</p>
Abstract: Over the last few decades, numerous scholars have documented the fact that in general, people of color and other socio-economically marginalized groups in the United States experience a disproportionate burden of environmental challenges - this pattern is referred to as environmental justice (EJ). Satellite Earth Observations (EO) can be used to monitor air quality, water quality, extreme weather and other quantities relevant to Environmental Justice. However the application of this technology in measuring environmental justice, or supporting EJ advocacy efforts has not been widely explored. 
On a high level, I study technological and methodological interventions in the pursuit of environmental justice and liberatory politics. This is explored through case study research of prison ecology in the United States, an environmental justice issue referring to a pattern of exposure to environmental hazards in carceral landscapes. The first phase of research employs semi-structured interviews with community organizers to understand the potential role and limitations of geospatial data in EJ organizing. Several ethical considerations came up in the design of this research which will be the topic of the presentation to the class. I will share reflections on interview protocol design, recruitment, informed consent and privacy.

Jacob Aaron Kodner is an incoming PhD student in Linguistics at Harvard University. He is interested in the grammatical structure of a variety of East Asian languages, especially those that are endangered and not as well-researched. He has studied verb constructions in Manchu, a critically endangered language of China, and has worked with speakers of this language to develop an online recorded dictionary. He has also conducted fieldwork with speakers of Atayal, an endangered and indigenous language of Taiwan, to research how speakers convey sources of evidence. His presentation will cover fieldwork as a research method, specifically through the lens of his research on Atayal.

### Dawn Anderson (June 21st)
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Dawn%20Anderson.png" width="15%"> 
Dawn is a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Boston in the School for Global Inclusion and Social Development.  She has been working to strengthen the cultural and community responsiveness of teachers in K-12 classrooms by centering the local history and contributions of Indigenous and Black communities.  By merging her interests in historic preservation, travel, photography, performing arts, and genealogy, she supports teachers in Illinois and Massachusetts who are working to strengthen their cultural and community responsiveness.  For her multiple case study, she uses an explanatory sequential mixed-method approach to better understand teacher participants background, practices, and beliefs.  The aim of her dissertation project is to explain why local black history has not been taught, challenges teaching it and the impact on students. 
Professionally, Dawn has worked in the field of International Education at Northeastern University and in Residential Life at MIT.  She is a wife, mother and a proud House Head from the suburbs of Chicago.

I was born with the “horse bug” and after spending 12 years training and competing young horses I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the equine industry. I went on to finish my B.S. at the University of Minnesota, then I completed a yearlong internship with Kentucky Equine Research which propelled me into my M.S. degree in an equine lab at the University of Florida. There I developed skills in Markerless pose estimation to track locomotor phenotypes in the elite sport horse. My love of horses and my growing passion for teaching led me to my position as a professor at the College of Central Florida. I hope to continue teaching equine science by showing how AI technology, genetics, and physiology can greatly improve the modern-day horse.

Gia completed her B.Sc. in Biology with a Minor in Chemistry from the University of The Bahamas (2020), after which she pursued a postgraduate diploma in Biomedical Science from Keele University (2021). Then in continued pursuit of higher education, she also completed a master’s degree in Biomedical Science (Blood Science) from Keele University (2022). Her research work consists of using deep neural networks and artificial intelligence for the establishment of a motor skills assessment tool for muscle-wasting conditions. She is currently due to continue her research work at Keele University as a technical assistant this spring. Gia has also been chosen as a 2023 DeepLabCut AI resident fellow and will be improving her artificial intelligence and DeepLabCut skills in Switzerland this coming summer.

### Michelle Verhoeven

My name is Michelle Verhoeven, I am Dutch and decided to join the academic world by exchanging my small hometown for the big capital Amsterdam to start studying. There, I graduated from the Research Master in Human Movement Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. For my master thesis, I conducted a validation study on using DeepLabCut for gait analysis in adults and newly walking toddlers. I recently moved to Belgium to start a PhD at Ghent University. My current research aims to investigate Selective Motor Control during gait (SMCg) in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and cerebral palsy (CP).

Nathan Kirkpatrick is a biomedical engineering grad student at Georgia Tech & Emory University. He uses DeepLabCut and neuromodulation techniques to study how rats adapt to nerve injury. Specifically, he uses DLC to recognize skeletal landmarks in biplanar high-speed x-ray video to monitor how animals compensate for the loss of peripheral signaling. He has undergraduate degrees in BME and English literature and was a Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines for two years. After finishing his PhD, he hopes to get a job in industry working for a medical device company.
