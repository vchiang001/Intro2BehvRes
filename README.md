In this class, I hope to present the class with relatable role models from diverse backgrounds, especially those representing a diversity of marginalized identities. I want the class to see them as full people with humanizing information, including their research and their contributions to their field. For this effort, some resources I consulted include:  www.500queerscientists.com, www.500womenscientists.org, www.projectbiodiversify.org, www.diversifyeeb.org, www.scientistspotlights.org, www.skypeascientist.com, and www.blackintheivory.com.

### Sakeena Mihar (November 15th)
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Sakeena_Mihar.jpg" width="30%"> 
Sakeena Mihar is the CEO and co-founder of Savyn, an award-winning social impact venture for inclusive digital mental health care providing virtual PTSD therapies in multiple languages based in Toronto, Ontario. Savyn removes barriers to accessing mental health support to heal trauma for vulnerable groups like refugees, immigrants, veterans and other trauma survivors. Savyn has won the Desjardin Cooperathon - Social Impact award, PennyAppeal Social Accelerator fund and is currently being incubated at Biomedical Zone, a partnership with St Michael’s hospital, and Social Ventures Zone at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). Sakeena also wears other hijabs in addition to being a founder. Sakeena is an equity, inclusion and social justice consultant and trainer. She runs workshops on Islamophobia, bystander intervention, equity and inclusion issues for several organizations, startups and political parties. She is also a speaker on gendered Islamophobia and spoken at the White Privilege conference in Toronto and at other events. She co-foundedof the first Muslim Faculty and Staff community network at TMU, advocating for systemic changes and implementing policy changes.

### Neslihan Wittek (November 17th) 
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Neslihan_Wittek.jpg" width="30%"> 
Postdoctoral researcher at the biopsychology department of the Ruhr University Bochum. She focuses on pigeons' decision-making and self-recognition. While doing behavioral experiments, she also explores challenging analyzing methods and the field of data science. That is also one of the reasons why she is interested in open-source technology ( which helps her not get lost in the thorny paths and thick forests of scientific computing :)) The field of behavioral sciences is currently taken by storm by the exciting new developments and technologies that emerge from the fields of artificial intelligence and new capabilities of processing hardware alike. Those developments, in conjunction with the open science movement, have given rise to exciting new open source projects that start to reshape the way we conduct science and research in all kinds of fields of natural science. One such example is the OSS library DeepLabCut. Standing on the shoulders of giants, just as Newton said, it is written in Python and uses deep learning architectures provided by TensorFlow to track animal movement in video recordings in the 2D as well as in the 3D space. And although this library is targeted at animal pose estimation use cases of researchers, it is so generic in nature that it can be used in very different use cases, such as eye-tracking. In this talk, I'd like to give you a demonstration of the capabilities of the DeepLabCut in my pigeon experiments.

### Han Spinner (December 1st)
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Han_Spinner.jpg" width="15%"> 
I am Han Spinner, my pronouns are they/them, and I am a PhD candidate at Harvard in the lab of Debora Marks. I went to UC Berkeley (yay state schools!) and studied Genetics and Plant Biology with a minor in Food Systems. After undergrad, I worked at a CRISPR protein engineering startup called Scribe Therapeutics. In graduate school, my research focuses on machine learning and protein design. My guest lecture will describe some of the fundamental data analysis tools people use when doing research. I am very open to questions about anything and am looking forward to the conversation with your class.
