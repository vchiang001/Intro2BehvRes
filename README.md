In this class, I hope to present the class with relatable role models from diverse backgrounds, especially those representing a diversity of marginalized identities. I want the class to see them as full people with humanizing information, including their research and their contributions to their field. For this effort, some resources I consulted include:

### Alec Hall (January 31st)
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Alec%20Hall.jpg" width="15%"> 
Alec Hall is a third-year doctoral School Psychology student from UMASS Boston. Alec Hall is a native of Coney Island—a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. While Coney Island has a distinct history of being one of the world's first amusement park areas, it is a diverse lower socioeconoemic community filled with systematic and racial injustices. Alec initially wanted to begin his career as an FBI agent to fight crime but seen family members and friends subjected to the mass incarceration system and he changed his trajectory to work with people impacted by the incarceration system and later on youth. Alec received his BA  in Forensic Psychology from CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice, his MS.Ed.in Mental Health Counseling from CUNY Hunter and a M.Ed. in School Psychology from UMASS Boston last semester. Alec has done clinical work as a therapist and psychologist in training with varying populations such as young adults, incarcerated women, people with developmental disabilities, and youth with mental health issues. His passion is using his clinical, research, and consultation skills to improve educational systems for youth to prevent further incarceration in adulthood.

My name is Sabrina and I'm from Argentina. I'm a physicist from Buenos Aires University and now I'm a PhD student in the Physiology and Algorithms of the Brain Lab and a teaching assistant at the University of Buenos Aires also. My motivation has always been to do experiments combined with big data analysis, so I'm studying how memories are formed in the brain of rodents in association with behavior. For that I'm using a miniscope and Deeplabcut, two amazing open source tools that I will introduce to you.

Michelle Kunimoto is a postdoctoral scholar at MIT working on NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Her research aims to understand the demographics and diversity of planets beyond our Solar System ("exoplanets"), especially through exoplanet discovery, exoplanet characterization, and the development of new tools and statistical frameworks for analyzing exoplanet survey data. Across all of her planet-hunting endeavours, Dr. Kunimoto has found over 2500 planets and planet candidates. She will talk about her research on conducting surveys for new exoplanets, and how these surveys can bias our understanding of planet populations.

I am a PhD Candidate in Classical Archaeology in the Department of Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Studies at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). I have been working as a field archaeologist for more than a decade, and since 2015 I am a senior member of the NYU-UniMi archaeological expedition in Selinunte, Italy. My main research interests are connectivity and local responses to globalization in the Iron Age Mediterranean. I will briefly talk about archaeological research: how does fieldwork…work? How do we approach physical remains of buildings and objects? And how do we interpret an incomplete record?

Hi my name is Daniela Hernandez and I am from Honduras. I studied EE/Physics in undergrad and Im currently pursuing a MEng in Surgery and Intervention at Vanderbilt. I love learning about AI and using DeepLabCut on a daily basis. Feel free to ask me anything and look forward to getting to know you!

### Madelyn Smythe

I was born with the “horse bug” and after spending 12 years training and competing young horses I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the equine industry. I went on to finish my B.S. at the University of Minnesota, then I completed a yearlong internship with Kentucky Equine Research which propelled me into my M.S. degree in an equine lab at the University of Florida. There I developed skills in Markerless pose estimation to track locomotor phenotypes in the elite sport horse. My love of horses and my growing passion for teaching led me to my position as a professor at the College of Central Florida. I hope to continue teaching equine science by showing how AI technology, genetics, and physiology can greatly improve the modern-day horse.

Ask me where I'm from and I will answer you with a list of places where I have been. Born in Buenos Aires, raised in the Denver, and currently living Mexico City, I'm wrapping up my PhD in Biomedical Science (neuroscience track) at UNAM. I am want to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms that link social status to reward through the lens of computational neuroethology. I’m passionate about harnessing machine learning to study naturalistic behavior and currently using pose estimation to automatize the classification of social interactions.

### Jokubas Ausra

Being born in Lithuania and moving to Chicago, Dr. Ausra settled down in the Sunshine State of Arizona. After graduating with his B.S. in Chemical Engineering, Jokubas pursued further education in biofeedback research by studying how animal behavior can guide wireless power transfer to implantable sensors and stimulators for neural and cardiac applications. After receiving his Ph.D. in biomedical engineering, Dr. Ausra is working toward his goal of integrating physiological sensors with automatic control of the environment for people with disabilities. In his free time, he enjoys building breadboard computers, automating home appliances, and playing with pets.

### Gia Hepburn

Gia completed her B.Sc. in Biology with a Minor in Chemistry from the University of The Bahamas (2020), after which she pursued a postgraduate diploma in Biomedical Science from Keele University (2021). Then in continued pursuit of higher education, she also completed a master’s degree in Biomedical Science (Blood Science) from Keele University (2022). Her research work consists of using deep neural networks and artificial intelligence for the establishment of a motor skills assessment tool for muscle-wasting conditions. She is currently due to continue her research work at Keele University as a technical assistant this spring. Gia has also been chosen as a 2023 DeepLabCut AI resident fellow and will be improving her artificial intelligence and DeepLabCut skills in Switzerland this coming summer.

### Michelle Verhoeven
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Michelle%20Verhoeven.jpeg" width="15%"> 
My name is Michelle Verhoeven, I am Dutch and decided to join the academic world by exchanging my small hometown for the big capital Amsterdam to start studying. There, I graduated from the Research Master in Human Movement Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. For my master thesis, I conducted a validation study on using DeepLabCut for gait analysis in adults and newly walking toddlers. I recently moved to Belgium to start a PhD at Ghent University. My current research aims to investigate Selective Motor Control during gait (SMCg) in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and cerebral palsy (CP).

Nathan Kirkpatrick is a biomedical engineering grad student at Georgia Tech & Emory University. He uses DeepLabCut and neuromodulation techniques to study how rats adapt to nerve injury. Specifically, he uses DLC to recognize skeletal landmarks in biplanar high-speed x-ray video to monitor how animals compensate for the loss of peripheral signaling. He has undergraduate degrees in BME and English literature and was a Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines for two years. After finishing his PhD, he hopes to get a job in industry working for a medical device company.
