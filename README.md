Hi my name is Daniela Hernandez and I am from Honduras. I studied EE/Physics in undergrad and Im currently pursuing a MEng in Surgery and Intervention at Vanderbilt. I love learning about AI and using DeepLabCut on a daily basis. Feel free to ask me anything and look forward to getting to know you!

### Madelyn Smythe
<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Madelyn%20Smythe.jpg" width="15%"> 
I was born with the “horse bug” and after spending 12 years training and competing young horses I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the equine industry. I went on to finish my B.S. at the University of Minnesota, then I completed a yearlong internship with Kentucky Equine Research which propelled me into my M.S. degree in an equine lab at the University of Florida. There I developed skills in Markerless pose estimation to track locomotor phenotypes in the elite sport horse. My love of horses and my growing passion for teaching led me to my position as a professor at the College of Central Florida. I hope to continue teaching equine science by showing how AI technology, genetics, and physiology can greatly improve the modern-day horse.

### Hongbin (Ben) Lin

<img src="https://github.com/vchiang001/Intro2BehvRes/blob/main/Images/Michelle%20Verhoeven.jpeg" width="15%"> 
My name is Michelle Verhoeven, I am Dutch and decided to join the academic world by exchanging my small hometown for the big capital Amsterdam to start studying. There, I graduated from the Research Master in Human Movement Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. For my master thesis, I conducted a validation study on using DeepLabCut for gait analysis in adults and newly walking toddlers. I recently moved to Belgium to start a PhD at Ghent University. My current research aims to investigate Selective Motor Control during gait (SMCg) in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and cerebral palsy (CP).

### Nathan Kirkpatrick

Nathan Kirkpatrick is a biomedical engineering grad student at Georgia Tech & Emory University. He uses DeepLabCut and neuromodulation techniques to study how rats adapt to nerve injury. Specifically, he uses DLC to recognize skeletal landmarks in biplanar high-speed x-ray video to monitor how animals compensate for the loss of peripheral signaling. He has undergraduate degrees in BME and English literature and was a Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines for two years. After finishing his PhD, he hopes to get a job in industry working for a medical device company.
